	The morning mist hung in the air as light from the rising sun penetrated the stillness of the forest. The sound
of birds chirping and trees groaning in the light breeze notified the waking of the glade from its slumber. Savarax Exin
awoke from his sleep as rays of sun started to beat down on his forehead. He was wrapped in a light deerskin blanket, 
sword and morningstar well within reach. He stretched and woke his stubborn body from its sleep looking out into the glade.
Not far off a stream bubbled and a woodpecker could be heard hammering into a nearby tree.
